## Design Systems in Figma

* Icons and Vector Networks https://designcode.io/figma-icons-and-vector-network
* Editing a vector, hit enter - vector editing can manipulate the network and paths
* (in vector edit mode) P: pen tool
* (in vector edit mode) B: pane bucket
* (in vector edit mode) P: shift/hold down click to edit bezier curves
* pen mode: editing a point, toggle mirroring and length to adjust curve mirroring/length or no mirroring
* shift+P: pencil tool
* cmd+e: flatten

## General Notes

* The vector networks editing / vector editing tool makes it actually quite easy to make some simple 3D shapes
* Editing, selecting, adjusting faces as well as a range of points along a set of paths is really handy
