# February 27, 2020 - Day 1

# Learning Swift

Today I plan on:

* Use Swift Playground in XCode 11
* Setup my iPhone + Watch as devices to deploy to
* Read through a chapter or two of Swift Programming Language 5.2 Book

Today I accomplished:

* Simple Value Types

```
// types: string, integers
var str = "Hello, playground"
var age = 38
var population = 8_000_000

// multi-line strings (triple quote)
var str1 = """
This goes
over multiple lines
"""

// add backslash to avoid linebreaks (similar to bash)
var st2 = """
This goes \
over multiple \
lines
"""
// doubles and booleans
var pi = 3.14159
// you can't mix doubles and integers by accident
// booleans true or false
var awesome = true

// string interpolation (backslash parens + variable)
var score = 85
var str3 = "Your score was \(score)"
var results = "The test results are: \(str3)"

// string interpolation can actually run code as well
var res = "The tests are: \(score * 3)"


// constants, values that are set once and can not be changed
let test = "value" // constant that uses let
```

* Type Annotations

```
// type annotations
let str4 = "hello" // type inference
let album: String = "Reputation" // type annotation
let year: Int = 1987
let height: Double = 1.75
let rocks: Bool = true
```

* Arrays, Collections, Sets, Tuples, Dictionaries

```
// arrays
let john = "john"
let paul = "paul"
let george = "george"
let ringo = "ringo"

let beatles = [john, paul, george, ringo]
beatles[1] // do not read an item that doesn't exist, it crashes, unlike javascript which returns undefined
let beatles2: [String] = [john, paul, george, ringo] // type annotated

// sets!
let colors = Set(["red", "green", "blue"]) // stored in a random order, unordered

// tuples
var name = (first: "Bob", last: "Swift")
name.0
name.first

// you can't add or remove items from a tuple, they are fixed
// you can't change the type of items in a tuple, they always have the same types they were created with
// you can access items in a tuple using numerical positions, or by naming,

// arrays vs sets vs tuples
let address = (house: 555, street: "tayl", city: "nash")
let set = Set(["bleh", "bl"])
let p = ["hi", "two"]

// dictionaries
let heights = [
    "bleh": 1.9,
    "hi": 4.4
]
heights["bleh"]

// empty collections
var teams = [String: String]()
teams["Paul"] = "Red"

var resultss = [Int]()

var words = Set<String>()
var numbs = Set<Int>()
var scores = Dictionary<String, Int>()
var re44 = Array<Int>()
```

* Enumerations + Associated Value Enums

```
// enumerations
enum Res {
    case success
    case failure
}

let b = Res.success

// enumerations with associated values (attached additional information)
enum Activity {
    case bored
    case running(destination: String)
    case talking(topic: String)
    case singing(volume: Int, topic: String)
}

let talking = Activity.running(destination: "bleh")

// enumeration raw values
enum Active: Int {
    case mercury = 1
    case earth = 2
}
let a = Active(rawValue: 2)
```
