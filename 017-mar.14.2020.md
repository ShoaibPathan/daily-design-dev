As you remember, we already talked about diffing in SwiftUI, but let me remind how it works. Whenever you change the source of truth for your views like @State or @ObservableObject, SwiftUI runs body property of your view to generate a new one. As the last step, SwiftUI renders a new view if something changed. The process of calculating a new body depends on how deep is your view hierarchy.

```
The User Interface in SwiftUI is a function of its state. It means whenever the viewâ€™s state changes, it recomputes its body property and generates a new view
