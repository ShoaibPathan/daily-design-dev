# March 2, 2020 - Day 5

Today I learned:

* Defer Operations

```
var fridgeIsOpen = false
let fridgeContent = ["milk", "eggs", "leftovers"]

func fridgeContains(_ food: String) -> Bool {
    fridgeIsOpen = true
    defer {
        fridgeIsOpen = false
    }

    let result = fridgeContent.contains(food)
    return result
}
fridgeContains("banana")
print(fridgeIsOpen)
```

* Assert, Preconditions

```
let age = -3
assert(age >= 0, "A person's age can't be less than zero.")
// This assertion fails because -3 is not >= 0.

precondition(index > 0, "Index must be greater than zero.")
```

* Math Operators, Comparison Operators, Identity Operators (===, !==), Logical Operators

* Ternary

```
let contentHeight = 40
let hasHeader = true
let rowHeight = contentHeight + (hasHeader ? 50 : 20)
```

* Nil Coalescing Operator

```
let defaultColorName = "red"
var userDefinedColorName: String?   // defaults to nil

var colorNameToUse = userDefinedColorName ?? defaultColorName
```

* Range Operators

```
for i in 1...5 { // closed range, 1 to and including 5
}

for i in 1..<5 { // half open range, 1 to and less than 5
}

for i in names[2...] { // open range, i in names starting at index 2 to the last item
}

for i in names[...2] { // open range, i in names from 0 to and including 2
}

let a = ...5 // can also use closed range as assignment to array
```

* Strings are Value Types
