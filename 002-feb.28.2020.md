# Learning Swift

Today I plan on:

* Reading through more of Swift Programming Language 5.2, work on control flow

Today I learned:

* If, Switch, Loops

```
let individualScores = [75, 43, 103, 87, 12]
var teamScore = 0
for score in individualScores {
    if score > 50 {
        teamScore += 3
    } else {
        teamScore += 1
    }
}
print(teamScore)
// Prints "11”

```
var optionalString: String? = "Hello"
print(optionalString == nil)
// Prints "false"

var optionalName: String? = "John Appleseed"
var greeting = "Hello!"
if let name = optionalName {
    greeting = "Hello, \(name)"
}”

```
let vegetable = "red pepper"
switch vegetable {
case "celery":
    print("Add some raisins and make ants on a log.")
case "cucumber", "watercress":
    print("That would make a good tea sandwich.")
case let x where x.hasSuffix("pepper"):
    print("Is it a spicy \(x)?")
default:
    print("Everything tastes good in soup.")
}
// Prints "Is it a spicy red pepper?”
