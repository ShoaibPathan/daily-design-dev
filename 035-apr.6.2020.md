```
The method in a nutshell allows you to execute code on the next available screen repaint, 
taking the guess work out of getting in sync with the user's browser and hardware readiness 
to make changes to the screen.

Use: timestamp in requestAnimationFrame to calculate percentage through a given animation to animate 
a given property or set of properties. Any animation can be derived as applying a function over time where
f(t) vs f(t+1) and t represents a particular time step calculated from the difference in time stamps.
