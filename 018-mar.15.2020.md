* Super helpful notes on SwiftUI State Management (change to framework) https://www.pointfree.co/blog/posts/30-swiftui-and-state-management-corrections

```swift
/**

The main mechanism for turning your models into objects that can be bound in views was a protocol named BindableObject. Conforming to this protocol required you to provide a didChange publisher that you would ping just after you made any changes to your model. For example:

*/

import SwiftUI

class AppState: BindableObject {
  let didChange = PassthroughSubject<Void, Never>()

  var count = 0 {
    didSet { self.didChange.send() }
  }

  var favoritePrimes: [Int] = [] {
    didSet { self.didChange.send() }
  }
}

/**

However, as of Xcode 11 beta 5 this protocol has been renamed to ObservableObject (and moved from the SwiftUI framework to the Combine framework), and you are now required to notify a publisher when your model is about to change rather than after it is changed. This means the above code snippet should now look like this:

*/

import Combine

class AppState: ObservableObject {
  let objectWillChange = ObservableObjectPublisher()

  var count = 0 {
    willSet { self.objectWillChange.send() }
  }

  var favoritePrimes: [Int] = [] {
    willSet { self.objectWillChange.send() }
  }
}

/**

There is also a change in Xcode 11 beta 5 that greatly simplifies how one creates observable objects. The amount of boilerplate required to implement the ObservableObject protocol was pretty significant. Just look at what happens to our AppState if we add two more properties:

*/

import Combine

class AppState: ObservableObject {
  let objectWillChange = ObservableObjectPublisher()

  var count = 0 {
    willSet { self.objectWillChange.send() }
  }

  var favoritePrimes: [Int] = [] {
    willSet { self.objectWillChange.send() }
  }

  var activityFeed: [Activity] = [] {
    willSet { self.objectWillChange.send() }
  }

  var loggedInUser: User? = nil {
    willSet { self.objectWillChange.send() }
  }
}

/**

This was one of the problems that we discussed in part 3 of our series, and luckily Xcode 11 beta 5 provides a solution. It is now possible for SwiftUI to automatically synthesize the objectWillChange for you, and by using the @Published property wrapper you can automatically have the publisher pinged when any of your fields change:

*/

import Combine

class AppState: ObservableObject {
  @Published var count = 0
  @Published var favoritePrimes: [Int] = []
  @Published var activityFeed: [Activity] = []
  @Published var loggedInUser: User? = nil
}

```

** This all explains the use of the `@Published` `@ObservedObject` vs `@ObjectBinding`, `ObservableObject` vs `BindableObject`
