* Super helpful notes on SwiftUI State Management (change to framework) https://www.pointfree.co/blog/posts/30-swiftui-and-state-management-corrections

```swift
/**

The main mechanism for turning your models into objects that can be bound in views was a protocol named BindableObject. Conforming to this protocol required you to provide a didChange publisher that you would ping just after you made any changes to your model. For example:

*/

import SwiftUI

class AppState: BindableObject {
  let didChange = PassthroughSubject<Void, Never>()

  var count = 0 {
    didSet { self.didChange.send() }
  }

  var favoritePrimes: [Int] = [] {
    didSet { self.didChange.send() }
  }
}

/**

However, as of Xcode 11 beta 5 this protocol has been renamed to ObservableObject (and moved from the SwiftUI framework to the Combine framework), and you are now required to notify a publisher when your model is about to change rather than after it is changed. This means the above code snippet should now look like this:

*/

import Combine

class AppState: ObservableObject {
  let objectWillChange = ObservableObjectPublisher()

  var count = 0 {
    willSet { self.objectWillChange.send() }
  }

  var favoritePrimes: [Int] = [] {
    willSet { self.objectWillChange.send() }
  }
}

```

** This all explains the use of the `@Published` `@ObservedObject` vs `@ObjectBinding`, `ObservableObject` vs `BindableObject`
